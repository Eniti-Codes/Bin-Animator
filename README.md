# Bin-Animator (for Linux)

Welcome to the **Bin Animator for Linux** project\! This is an open-source initiative to bring an animated trashcan icon to Linux, specifically designed to visually remind you to empty your bin based on how long items have been sitting there.

-----

### The Inspiration

This project was directly inspired by the macOS app **"Banana Bin"**, which I became aware of through a **UFD Tech** YouTube Short. That video showcased an app that animates the trashcan icon, and I loved the idea\! I felt that animating based on how *long* items have been left in the bin would be even more effective and unique â€“ truly capturing that "forgotten trash" feeling.

### My Journey & Project Status

As a developer, this is my **first ever Operating System-level project**, so it's a significant learning experience for me. I'm actively working on it, focusing on getting it stable and functional for Linux Mint users.

**Currently, the project is under active development.** I'm tackling the intricacies of OS integration and desktop environment interaction. While I'm pushing hard to get it working perfectly, I'm committed to the spirit of open-source. This means even if I hit a wall and can't get it fully polished, I'll release the code so others can pick it up, learn from it, and hopefully contribute to its completion.

-----

### Free & Open Source

True to the philosophy of the free and open-source community, this project will always be **100% free and open source**. You'll be able to view, use, modify, and distribute the code as you wish.
