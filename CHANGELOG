 Current updates!

Made an entire setup file for those that want it to run in the background on their system. This would include installing and uninstalling it from the background processes.

The README has been fully redesigned. to encourage those to run it as a background process because it's the most efficiently

Fix the prints not working when you run it strictly in terminal. I thought it would be a way more complex issue to fix. I just had to copy and paste some old code that I was messing with and it just functioned. So here's the update.
